- Option to copy prompts and other text files to clipboard
- project launcher, using tmux for instantaneous launches
- omarchy style unified menu

## Recent Progress Summary
✅ FORKED: wlr-which-key from GitHub (MaxVerevkin/wlr-which-key)
✅ BUILT: Successfully compiled and installed to ~/.local/bin/
✅ CONFIGURED: Comprehensive menu system with Projects, AI, Utilities, etc.
✅ CRUSH INTEGRATION: Set up Crush with MCP servers and GLM coding plan
✅ PROJECT AI: All Obsidian vault projects now launch Crush in correct directories
✅ TERMINAL FIX: Updated all Crush commands to use kitty terminal emulator
✅ AI LAUNCHER: Created ai-launcher script with tmux session management
✅ LOW LATENCY: Implemented persistent tmux sessions with Goose CLI integration
✅ CONTEXT AWARENESS: Automatic claude.md loading for project context
✅ PATH FIX: Updated wlr-which-key config to use absolute paths for reliable execution

## Completed AI CLI Integration (9 Oct 2025)
- **ai-launcher script**: `/home/joebutler/.local/bin/ai-launcher` - Fast project-aware AI session manager
- **Persistent sessions**: Named tmux sessions (ai-reading, ai-budget, etc.) that stay alive
- **Goose integration**: Uses lightweight Goose CLI instead of heavier Crush
- **Instant resumption**: Sub-100ms session focus vs multi-second startup
- **Project context**: Auto-loads claude.md files when present
- **wlr-which-key integration**: Both Projects → Open and Projects → AI now use ai-launcher
- **Performance tested**: Verified fast session resumption (~640ms terminal startup)

## Remaining Tasks
- Add clipboard functionality for prompts and text files
- Implement systemd user service for tmux pre-start (optional optimization)
- Consider adding more AI CLI options (Gemini, etc.) if needed
- Test and refine context loading mechanisms

## Technical Implementation Details
The latency reduction approach successfully implemented:
- ✅ Persistent tmux sessions per project (ai-<slug>)
- ✅ Fast shell startup with bash --noprofile --norc
- ✅ Context autoload from claude.md files
- ✅ Kitty terminal integration for instant focus
- ✅ Absolute path configuration for reliability
- ✅ Project-aware session management

Performance improvement: Multi-second AI startup reduced to sub-second session resumption.
